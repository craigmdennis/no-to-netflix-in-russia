  <h1>Dear Netflix,</h1>
  <p>I write to you in protest against the continued operation of your service in Russia after March 1st when you will be required to broadcast Russian federal television stations closely linked with the Kremlin. Such stations are a key part of Putin's propaganda dissemination to the Russian people and are being used to justify the unprovoked and abhorrent invasion of the sovreign nation Ukraine.</p>
  <p>I am a long-standing Netflix customer but I will be forced to cancel my subscription if you do not cease your services in Russia.</p>
  <p>While my subscription alone is meaningless to you, the negative publicity that comes with your tacit complicity in Russian propaganda will no-doubt cause others to cancel as well.</p>
